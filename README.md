# Bangkit-Capstone-Project
## **This is a repo on Bangkit Academy Capstone Project - Covid-19 Vaccines Sentiment Analysis**
### General Description
In this project, our goal is to build a machine learning model based on NLP to detect sentiment analysis on vaccination COVID-19 in Indonesia.
The analysis is based on tweets that Indonesian post on their Twitter account.

We classify the tweets as follows:
1. Positive sentiment
2. negative sentiment
3. neutral sentiment

If some of the tweets are considered to be non related to covid-19 vaccination, the tweets will not be involved in dataset.

### Project flow
1. Data cleaning and labelling
2. Exploration data analysis
3. Pre-processing text to numbers
4. Model building and training
5. Model validation and analysis

Important Files:
1. Data_Cleaning.ipynb for dataset cleaning and labeling
2. Baseline_model.ipynb for training the baseline model
